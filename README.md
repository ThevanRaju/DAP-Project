# 🩺 Data Analytics Programming Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores global healthcare data to understand and predict adolescent mortality rates. By integrating multiple datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO), we apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover insights about healthcare investment, medical staffing, and health outcomes.

## 📂 Datasets Used

The following datasets were obtained from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/data/):

- 👨‍⚕️ Medical Doctors per 10,000 Population  
- 💰 Current Health Expenditure per Capita (USD)  
- ⚰️ Adolescent Mortality Rate (per 1,000 age-specific cohort)  
- 🍬 Prevalence of Diabetes  

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Identify global patterns in adolescent mortality using healthcare indicators.
- Apply machine learning models to predict mortality trends.
- Visualize relationships between healthcare spending, medical access, and health outcomes.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Regression, Classification)
- GitHub for version control

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models Applied

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Feature Importance Analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Healthcare investment and availability of doctors show correlation with mortality rates.
- Certain countries with lower expenditure still achieve low mortality due to policy and accessibility.
- Feature importance models reveal healthcare expenditure and diabetes prevalence as significant predictors.
